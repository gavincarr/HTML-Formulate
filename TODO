+ implement support for hidden, display, and readonly fields
+ implement first-pass support for selects
+ add support for submit => 'SCALAR' (or 1), for just one submit button
+ should default be submit => 1 ? 
+ check submit => undef does the right thing
+ add xhtml support, closing empty tags like <input /> and <br /> appropriately
+ add formtype => 'table' support, reverting to vanilla Tabulate
+ cell_merge_extras is called too late for 'omit' fields, since row stuff
  already included
+ add support for top-level hidden hashref
+ work out where you would add clever datatype handlers to mess with field 
  attributes based on column types (prerender_munge)
+ work through what sort of next-level semantics you'd need to be able to 
  support to handle different formtypes semi-automatically e.g. create vs.
  edit vs. delete fields, timestamps (require undef) vs auto_increment 
  fields (omit on create, display otherwise) vs uids (static or omit?)
+ try out input defaults like 'size', 'maxlength'
+ check that textareas work as expected
+ check that custom field values work as expected (to drop in e.g. date
  widgets etc.)
+ ignore field 'links' setting unless type display or static
+ add marking of required/mandatory fields ('required' field list)
+ add support for validation error reporting ('errors' hash)
+ add errors_where location (column/top), and (top) errors_format args
+ add label %s sprintf support to error messages
+ add some DFV-type trickery to default required and errors formatting
+ allow field-less forms if fields is undefined/empty (just submits) 
+ allow field-less and submit-less forms if both fields and submits are
  undefined (useful for confirmation pages in FormFactory?)
+ move scalar required support from FF into Formulate
+ add generalised field_attr td handling, and special case td_error
+ add support for scalar errors_format (+ errors_format tests!)
+ allow errors hash to contain multiple errors per field (via arrayref)
+ need to allow submits to be either in table or out of table (in-table
  buttons look stupid if border=1), and appropriate presentation hooks
+ change 'format' to be applied after <input /> construction rather than before
+ fix selects to allow repeat values
+ rename 'vlist' to 'values'
+ allow values and vlabels to be subrefs
+ fix size inheritance issue on selects
+ fix inherited attributes on submits
+ Tabulate title and text should allow coderefs instead of just scalars
+ label => '' should render a row with an empty label
+ review whether omits are being handled properly
+ size/maxlength inheritance is still broken for non-text/password types
+ add back support for non-std labels on static fields, via vlabel
+ need to handle non-field-specific top-style errors properly
+ change empty vlist entries to render as <option value=""> instead of <option>
+ only add default submit if 'fields' is defined i.e. no fields no submit should
  do the right thing
+ hidden arrayrefs don't seem to be working
- need to add proper support for checkboxes and radio buttons (layout etc.)
- need to add docs on field attribute behaviour, including special handling
  of selects
- need to handle non-field-specific column-style errors properly
- should display requireds be marked as such? esp. required => 'ALL'
- add some proper perldocs
